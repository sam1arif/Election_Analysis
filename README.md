# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview (Election Audit):

  We were asked by the Colorado Board of Elections to audit the congressional election data and turn in our finding. Below are the areas this analysis focused on:
    
    1. Calculation of all the ballots casted in the election.
    
    2. Calculation of votes and its percentage by county. 
    
    3. The county with the largest voter tunrout.
    
    4. Candidate names, the sum of votes they received and the percentage of votes they received.
    
    5. The winner of the election.
    

## Election audit results:
  
  Below are the results we found:
  
    1. There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
    
    2. Number and percentage of votes each of the three counties received:
       a. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
       b. Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
       c. Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
    
    3. Out of the three counties, Denver had the largest voter turnout. Here is the link to the picture of the code we used to get this outcome. ![largest county vote](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96811934/158092758-fae13435-da46-44c7-832c-11ea263d04d8.png)
    
    4. Number and percentage of vote each of the three candidates received:
       a. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
       b. Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
       c. Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
    
    5. Diana DeGette won the election with a total of 272,892 votes. She won 73.8% of the total vote cast. 
    
 ## Audit summary:
 
  The code we used to find out the outcomes of the election from a large csv file could be used for any dataset with a change in variables, columns and rows according to the data. A similar code could be developed for the voting equipment to get real-time results within seconds to be used for all kinds of local, state and national elections. If the Colorado Board of Elections would give us the opportunity to work on this, we can develop an exclusive code for the Board (which will include trouble shooting) so the Board could extract results from hundreds of thousands, even millions of vote cast within seconds.
